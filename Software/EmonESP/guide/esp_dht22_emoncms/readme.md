# ESP DHT22 to Emoncms Example

An example made using the [Adafruit Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471) board with ESP-12 module and the DHT22 temperature humidity sensor.

This code example, when loaded onto the ESP will continuously upload temperature and humidity data onto [emoncms.org](https://emoncms.org)

[CP2102 USB to UART adapter](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/programmers) was used as power supply and to program the ESP. 
PlatformIO or Arduino IDE can be used to compile and upload code. See [PlatformIO compile and upload guide](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/compiling)
